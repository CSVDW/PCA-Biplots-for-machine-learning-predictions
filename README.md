# PCA-Biplots-for-machine-learning-predictions
Understanding machine learning predictions with biplots

Import data sets LUCAS_aggregated.txt and biplot_data.csv

Also includes script with complete examples of creating biplots with the R package ordr. 
The examples include biplots with points as well as with alpha-bags

In the biplot_data, the soc column are the machine learning predictions, and we want to visualise these predictions with the covariates in this data set (top 8 predictors)
